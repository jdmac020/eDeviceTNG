# CSCC CSCI-2630-Edevices 
### EDevices Project for the ReturnNull team, Spring Semester 2017

Just a simple ASP.NET/MVC5 application using Entity Framework designed to allow people to make insurance claims against their registered electronic devices.

Each "Milestone" represents the equivalent to a deployment--a feature had been successfully implemented (and submitted for grading). We would work in the development branch, branch it off to a milestone branch on implementation, merge THAT branch into master, then continue in development.

Aside from some shenanigans around milestone 5. We do not speak of milestone 5.
